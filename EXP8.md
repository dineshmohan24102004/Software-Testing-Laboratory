### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040039
### AIM: 
To write a python program for addition of two numbers and test the test cases using Pytest.
### Algorithm: 
Step 1: Write the python program for addition of two numbers. 
Step 2: Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested 
should have assert keyword at the beginning. 
Step 3: Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_add.py”. 
Step 4: Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is 
saved and type “pytest test_add.py” and run it. 
Step 5: Stop the program.
